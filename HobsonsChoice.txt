Hobson’s Choice:-
V1:
Hobson’s choice, in an unknown terrain, 
No other voice, unfounded remain,
Our Intuition, 's inner sound sayin'
"Step one's Admission", 'n helpin' explain,
C:
How Mountains connect us all
Like th' Whirl, o' a Prayer wheel,
Sounds from Tibet and Nepal
Flags unfurled make you feel
Encountered deeply enthralled
Sacred words so surreal,
So profound spinnin' Heart's fall  
make the world seem more real.
M8:
Proof's in a Talisman, led from Wrath towards destiny / guide to our own destiny / literally pick Any / Lit up our own destiny /littering destined Any, 
The Truth is always one, but The Paths are always many.


V2:
Hobson’s choice, means we must be humane 
An inner voice

Surrender comes second, 'n helpin' explain,

V3:
Hobson’s choice, makes us confront the pain 
leaps of faith

Acceptance, the last step, 'n helpin' explain,

No profound 
the mind's X ingrained,
search and help us explain,
unfurled a(s) sacred, 
yearning for lives lived more purposefully unfettered as carefree”
