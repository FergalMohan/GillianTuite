V2:
Hobson bemoaned choice, makes us confront the pain 
Cautioned by a lone voice, affront to Free-rein
intent to contend, with our bias ingrained 
Surrender comes second, 'n helpin' explain,
V3:
Hobson only choice, means we must be humane 
In Time Seeds sown rejoice, perspective regained
Repentance well-kept, is the key to attain
Acceptance, the last step, 'n helpin' explain,
M8:
Proof's in a Talisman, led from Wrath towards destiny,
The Truth is always one, but The Paths are always many.
