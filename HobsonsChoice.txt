The Spinnin' Heart
V1:
Hobson’s choice, in an unknown terrain, 
No other voice, unfounded remain,
Our Intuition, an inner sound's sayin'
"Step one is Admission", 'n helpin' explain,
C:
How Mountains connect us all
Like th' Whirl, o' a Prayer wheel,
Found in Tibet and Nepal
Flags unfurled make you feel
Encounters leave you enthralled
Sacred words now surreal,
Profound the spinnin' Heart's fall  
make the world seem more real.
V2:
Hobson’s choice, makes us confront the pain 
An inner voice, an affront to Free-rein
intent to contend, with our bias ingrained 
Surrender comes second, 'n helpin' explain,
V3:
Hobson’s choice, means we must be humane 
Time to rejoice, perspective to regain
Repentance well kept, is a key to attain
Acceptance, the last step, 'n helpin' explain,
M8:
Proof's in a Talisman, led from Wrath towards destiny / guide to our own destiny / literally pick Any / Lit up our own destiny /littering destined Any, 
The Truth is always one, but The Paths are always many.



No profound 
the mind's X ingrained,
search and help us explain,
unfurled a(s) sacred, 
yearning for lives lived more purposefully unfettered as carefree”
