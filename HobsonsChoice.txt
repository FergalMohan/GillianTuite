V2:
Hobson needs to own 's choice, to confront the pain 
Cop on to your inner voice, affrontin' Free-rein

Hobson's just a moral choice, respect gives humane 
OPtions trust 'n to rejoice, perspective regained
Repentance as Jesus wept, for our souls to attain
Acceptance, is the last step, 'n helpin' to explain,
M8:
Proof's beyond a Talisman, spared from Wrath by 'ur Destiny,
The Truth is always one, but The Paths are always many.
