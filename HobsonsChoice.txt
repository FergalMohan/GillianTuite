V2:
Hobson's A.K.A. no choice an,  affront to Free-rein
Caution take's a lonely voice in, confrontin' the pain

V3:
Hobson's just a moral choice self-, respect lives again 
Optionless but then rejoice felt, perspective's regained
Repentance 's highness wept, for OUR souls to attain
Acceptance, the final step, 'n helpin' to explain,

Proof's replaces Talisman, replace(d) Wrath 's Epiphany,
The Truth is always one, but The Paths are always many.
