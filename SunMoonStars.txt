Sun, Moon and Stars
		by Gillian Tuite & Fergal Mohan
(V1)Am/E	E7 (d#,e), F(FMaj7) E/G#
The sun is setting,	over empty seas
Am/E		E7	F	(FMaj7)
Star spangled banner, flapping in the breeze,
Dm	Dm7	G/D
The sting of salty tears
Am/E	G/D	F/C
Spiralled flashbacks through the years
Dm	G/D	Am/E
seems 't almost guarantees.
(C1) C	G/B,	Am 	Am/G
The sun will rise again and will cast
C	G/B,	Am 	Am/G
A light on flags again at half mast
F	Em7	Dm	G/D
A call to prayer, we all can share 
Am/E	E7 (d#,e)	F	G
Our empathy, to pray be freed,
F	G
From Human Greed, a seed o' time's past
(V2)  The moon is rising. Over urban skies
United Nations, flagging but it flies
A sign of hopes and fears
Fading old dreams, (soon) disappears
Seems to hardly recognise. 
(C1).. From Human Greed, no need fo' time's past
(V3) The stars are shining, over concrete waste
In Crescent moon light, a red cross interlaced
Entwined 'round Minurets
(Resurrections/ReCollections/Reflections o')Regrets
seems it's never been embraced.
(Br) You cannot eat your, flags to survive
We need much more, to keep us alive
(C1)...(No-one dies) A Human need, (a Dice a Deed), agreed to Recast.
