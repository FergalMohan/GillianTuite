Prayer Flags (Capo +5) (Key F)
		by Gillian Tuite & Fergal Mohan
(V1)Am/E E7 (d#,e), F(FMaj7) Eaug/G#(d#edb) Eaug
The sun's sparked Amber, windswept empty seas 
Am/E		E7	F (FMaj7) Eaug/G# (g# g f g)
Star Spangled Banner sill, -houetted in the breeze,
Dm/F	Dm7/F	G6(e) G (ed)
The sting of salty tears
Am/E		G/D	F/C	F/E F
Spiralled flashbacks through the years
Dm/A	Em/B   (e)	Am(aga) /G Am
Prayer Flags seem like guarantees.
(C1) C		G/B,		Am Em/G(ecbg)
The sun will rise again, and will cast
(/E)Cadd9/G 	(/G)Em/G, (/E)Am (b)(/E)C/G (cb c)
A light on flags maintained, at half mast
F	Em7(dde),	Dm	Dm7	G/D
A call to prayer, we all could share 
Am/E(ed)E7(bg#),F(edbg#ag#)E7, F FMaj7(edbg#)
Our (self-pity/sympathy), dying to be freed,
FMaj7(x3)->GMaj7 G F Em,/B/A/B(d#ed)Am /G Am
((From Human Greed)) o' times past
(V2)  The moon's eclipsed in, blackened city skies
U.N Branches ripped 'n', flagging but it flies
A sign of hopes and fears
Fading old dream, disappears
Prayer Flags seem to prophesize.
(C1).. ((sympathy))
(V3) The stars now shine on, loss 'n' war-torn waste
Crescent moon aligned an', red cross in one place
Redesigned Minurets 
Resignation(s) soon Regrets
Prayer Flags seem to be two-faced.
(M8) Dm/F	Em7/G,	Cadd9/G(c)Em/G(b)F
One looks to the future, one looks to the past
FMaj7		GMaj7,	Em	Em7(ded)   F FMaj7->GMaj7	
There's no second nature, there's no second class.
(Solo) Am/E E7 (d# e) F G, Am G F Em7 /D
(C2/Outro)The sun will rise again at what cost ?
Moon light on flags maintains, no one else's lost 
 New call to prayer, for us to share
Am/E	E7,	F 	E7, F FMaj7
Our empathy, prepare to BE, freed,
FMaj7(x3) -> GMaj7 G F Em,/G/F/E(d#ed)Am/E /G Am
o' History, no longer star-crossed
Eaug/G# = (g# c e) Eaug (e g# c e)
