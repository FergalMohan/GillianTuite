Prayer Flags (Capo +5) (Key F)
		by Gillian Tuite & Fergal Mohan
(V1)Am/E E7 (d#,e), F(FMaj7) Eaug/G#(d#edb) Eaug
The sun's gold amber,	sets on empty seas
Am/E		E7	F (FMaj7) Eaug/G# (g# g f g)
Star Spangled Banner pir, -ouetting in the breeze,
Dm	Dm7	G6 G/D (ed)
The sting of salty tears
Am/E		G/D	F/C		/B
Spiralled flashbacks through the years
Dm/A	Em/B   (e)	Am(g) /G Am
Prayer Flags seem like guarantees.
(C1) C		G/B,		Am Esus4(a+b+e)
The sun will rise again, and will cast
C/G		Em/G,	Am 	Am/G	(g e)
A light on flags maintained, at half mast
F	Em7(dde)	Dm	Dm7	G/D
A call to prayer, we all can share 
Am/E(ed)E7(bg#),F(edbg#ag#)E7, FMaj7(edbg#)
Our empathy, dying to be freed,
			Esus4 (b a)Am /G Am
((From Human Greed, bad seed)) o' times now passed
(V2)  The moon's eclipsed in, blackened city skies
U.N Branches ripped 'n', flagging but it flies
A sign of hopes and fears
Fading old dream, disappears
Prayer Flags seem to prophesize.
(C1).. ((From Human Greed, that need)) from time's long passed
(V3) The stars now shine on, loss 'n' war-torn waste
Crescent moon aligned 'n', red cross in one place
Entwined 'round Minurets
Resurrections o' Regrets
Prayer Flags seem to be two-faced.
(M8) Dm7	Em7,	Am/E		E7 (ee d# e)
One looks to the future, and one to the past
F		G,	C/G Em/G	Am 	Am/G
There's no second nature, there's no second class.
(Solo) Am/E E7 (d# e) F G, Am G F Em7 /D
(Out)The sun will rise again 'n' count cost
The moon lit flag declares, no one 's lost 
 New call to prayer, for all to share
Our empathy, prepare to be freed,
From History, no longer star-crossed
Eaug/G# = (g# c e) Eaug (e g# c e)
