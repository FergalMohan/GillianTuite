Sun, Moon and Stars (Capo +3)
		by Gillian Tuite & Fergal Mohan
(V1)Am/E	E7 (d#,e), F(FMaj7) Eaug/G#(d#edb) Eaug
The sun is setting,	over empty seas
Am/E		E7	F (FMaj7) Eaug/G# (g# g f g)
Star spangled banner, flapping in the breeze,
Dm	Dm7	G/D
The sting of salty tears
Am/E		G/D	F/C		/B
Spiralled flashbacks through the years
Dm/A	G	Am(g) /G Am
almost seems it guarantees.
(C1) C	G/B,	Am 	Am/G
The sun will rise again and will cast
C/G	Em/G,	Am 	Am/G
A light on flags again at half mast
F	Em7	Dm	Dm7	G/D
A call to prayer, we all can share 
Am/E	E7 (d#,e)	F	G
Our empathy, pray to be freed,
FMaj7		GMaj7,		Am /G Am
From Human Greed, bad seed o' time's past
(V2)  The moon is rising. Over urban skies
United Nations, flagging but it flies
A sign of hopes and fears
Fading old dreams, disappears
hardly seems to recognise. 
(C1).. From Human Greed, no need fo' time's past
(V3) The stars are shining, over concrete waste
In Crescent moon light, a red cross interlaced
Entwined 'round Minurets
(Resurrections/ReCollections/Reflections o')Regrets
never seems to be embraced.
(Br) Dm7	Em7,	Am/E		E7 (ee d# e)
that you can't eat your, flags 'n' hope to survive
F		G,	C/G 	Em/G	Am 	Am/G
We all need much more, to keep our hopes alive.
(Solo) Am/E	E7 (d#,e)	F	G, Am	G	F	Em7 /D
(Out)A Future freed, from Deed or Dice tossed ((from time's past))
A Human need, No-one dies, an out caste ((hope can outlast))
 The call to prayer, we all can share
Our empathy, pray to be freed,
From History, agree(d) to Recast.
Eaug/G# = (g# c e) Eaug (e g# c e)
