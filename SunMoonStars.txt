Sun, Moon and Stars (Capo +3)
		by Gillian Tuite & Fergal Mohan
(V1)Am/E	E7 (d#,e), F(FMaj7) Eaug/G#(d#edb) Eaug
The sun is blood red,	sets on empty seas
Am/E		E7	F (FMaj7) Eaug/G# (g# g f g)
Star Spangled Glory pir, -ouetting in the breeze,
Dm	Dm7	G/D
The sting of salty tears
Am/E		G/D	F/C		/B
Spiralled flashbacks through the years
Dm/A	G   (e)	Am(g) /G Am
almost seems it guarantees.
(C1) C	G/B,	Am 	Am/G
The sun will rise again and will cast
C/G	Em/G,	Am 	Am/G	(g e)
A light on flags again at half mast
F	Em7(dde)	Dm	Dm7	G/D
A call to prayer, we all can share 
Am/E E7 (d# e),F(c c a)	G (g e)
Our empathy(d), dying to be freed,
FMaj7		GMaj7,		Am /G Am
From Human Greed, bad seed o' time's past
(V2)  The moon's eclipsed on, jagged city skies
U.N Branches ripped 'n', flagging but it flies
A sign of hopes and fears
Fading old dreams, disappears
hardly seems to recognise. 
(C1).. From Human Greed, that need 's long passed
(V3) The stars are shining, 'cross a war-torn space
Crescent moon aligned 'n', red cross interlaced
Entwined 'round Minurets
Resurrections o' Regrets
never seems to be embraced.
(Br) Dm7	Em7,	Am/E		E7 (ee d# e)
that you can't eat your, flags 'n' hope to survive
F		G,	C/G Em/G	Am 	Am/G
We all need much more, to keep our hopes alive.
(Solo) Am/E E7 (d# e) F G, Am G F Em7 /D
(Out)A Future freed, from Deed or Dice tossed
A Human need, No-one dies, no one 's lost 
 The call to prayer, we all can share
Our empathy, prepare to be freed,
From History, no longer star-crossed
Eaug/G# = (g# c e) Eaug (e g# c e)
