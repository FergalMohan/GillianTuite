Sun, Moon and Stars (Capo +3)
		by Gillian Tuite & Fergal Mohan
(V1)Am/E	E7 (d#,e), F(FMaj7) Eaug/G#(d#edb) Eaug
The sun is setting,	deep red over empty seas
Am/E		E7	F (FMaj7) Eaug/G# (g# g f g)
Star spangled banner, fading in the breeze,
Dm	Dm7	G/D
The sting of salty tears
Am/E		G/D	F/C		/B
Spiralled flashbacks through the years
Dm/A	G   (e)	Am(g) /G Am
almost seems it guarantees.
(C1) C	G/B,	Am 	Am/G
The sun will rise again and will cast
C/G	Em/G,	Am 	Am/G	(g e)
A light on flags again at half mast
F	Em7(dde)	Dm	Dm7	G/D
A call to prayer, we all can share 
Am/E E7 (d# e),F(c c a)	G (g e)
Our empathy, prayer to be freed,
FMaj7		GMaj7,		Am /G Am
From Human Greed, bad seed o' time's past
(V2)  The moon 's jagged, edging Over urban skies
United Nations, flagging but it flies
A sign of hopes and fears
Fading old dreams, disappears
hardly seems to recognise. 
(C1).. From Human Greed, that need 's long passed
(V3) The stars are shining, brightly over concrete waste
Crescent moon logo, light-red cross interlaced
Entwined 'round Minurets
Resurrections o' Regrets
never seems to be embraced.
(Br) Dm7	Em7,	Am/E		E7 (ee d# e)
that you can't eat your, flags 'n' hope to survive
F		G,	C/G 	Em/G	Am 	Am/G
We all need much more, to keep our hopes alive.
(Solo) Am/E	E7 (d# e)	F	G, Am	G	F	Em7 /D
(Out)A Future freed, from Deed or Dice tossed ((from time's past))
A Human need, No-one dies, no one 's lost ((hope can outlast))
 The call to prayer, we all can share
Our empathy, prayer to be freed,
From History, albeit star-crossed ((agree(d) to Recast))
Eaug/G# = (g# c e) Eaug (e g# c e)
